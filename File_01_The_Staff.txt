Subject: The Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines

The staff (or stave) is the foundation of written music. It consists of five horizontal lines and four spaces. Each line and each space represents a different musical pitch.

A clef is a symbol placed at the beginning of the staff that assigns a specific pitch to one of the lines. This assignment fixes the pitches for all the other lines and spaces.

The most common clefs are the Treble Clef and the Bass Clef.

Treble Clef (G-clef): The Treble Clef symbol has a curl that wraps around the second line from the bottom. This line becomes the pitch G above Middle C. This clef is used for higher-pitched instruments and voices, like the flute, violin, and the right hand of the piano. The lines, from bottom to top, represent the notes E, G, B, D, F (Every Good Boy Does Fine). The spaces represent F, A, C, E.

Bass Clef (F-clef): The Bass Clef symbol has two dots that surround the fourth line from the bottom. This line becomes the pitch F below Middle C. This clef is used for lower-pitched instruments and voices, like the cello, bassoon, and the left hand of the piano. The lines, from bottom to top, represent G, B, D, F, A (Good Boys Do Fine Always). The spaces represent A, C, E, G.

The Grand Staff is a combination of a Treble Clef staff and a Bass Clef staff joined together by a brace. It is commonly used for keyboard instruments like the piano. Middle C is the note located in the center of the Grand Staff, on a ledger line between the two staves.

Ledger Lines are short lines added above or below the main staff to extend its range, allowing for notes that are higher or lower than what the five lines and four spaces can represent
