Subject: Note Duration and Rests

In music, duration refers to the length of time a note is held. Different types of notes have different durations. The system is based on fractions.

Whole Note: The longest standard note duration. It is represented by an open, unfilled oval.
Half Note: Has half the duration of a Whole Note. It is represented by an open oval with a stem.
Quarter Note: Has a quarter of the duration of a Whole Note, or half the duration of a Half Note. It is represented by a filled-in (black) oval with a stem. It is the most common unit of beat in music.
Eighth Note: Has an eighth of the duration of a Whole Note. It is represented by a filled-in oval with a stem and a single flag. Eighth notes (and shorter notes) can be beamed together in groups.
Sixteenth Note: Has a sixteenth of the duration of a Whole Note. It is represented by a filled-in oval with a stem and two flags.
A dot placed after a notehead increases its duration by half of its original value. For example, a dotted half note is equal to a half note plus a quarter note.

A tie is a curved line that connects two notes of the same pitch. It merges them into a single, sustained note with a duration equal to the sum of the two individual notes.

Rests are symbols that indicate periods of silence in music. Each note duration has a corresponding rest symbol.

Whole Rest: Hangs from the fourth line.
Half Rest: Sits on the third line.
Quarter Rest: A squiggly line.
Eighth Rest: Has one flag.
Sixteenth Rest: Has two flags
