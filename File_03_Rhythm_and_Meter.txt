Subject: Measures, Time Signatures, and Meter

Music is organized into units called measures or bars. Each measure contains a specific number of beats. Measures are separated by barlines.

A Time Signature is a set of two numbers, one on top of the other, placed at the beginning of a piece of music.

Top Number: Indicates how many beats are in each measure.
Bottom Number: Indicates what type of note gets one beat. (e.g., 4 = Quarter Note, 2 = Half Note, 8 = Eighth Note).
Common Time Signatures:

4/4 (Common Time): Four beats per measure, and the quarter note gets one beat.
3/4: Three beats per measure, and the quarter note gets one beat. Often used for waltzes.
2/4: Two beats per measure, and the quarter note gets one beat. Often used for marches.
6/8: Six beats per measure, and the eighth note gets one beat. This is a compound meter, meaning the beats are naturally grouped into two sets of three eighth notes each.
Meter is the pattern of strong and weak beats in music.

Duple Meter: Two beats per measure (e.g., 2/4). The pattern is STRONG-weak.
Triple Meter: Three beats per measure (e.g., 3/4). The pattern is STRONG-weak-weak.
Quadruple Meter: Four beats per measure (e.g., 4/4). The pattern is STRONG-weak-Slightly Strong-weak.
Simple Meter is when the main beats are divided into two shorter notes (e.g., in 4/4, a quarter note beat divides into two eighth notes).
Compound Meter is when the main beats are divided into three shorter notes (e.g., in 6/8, the main dotted-quarter note beat divides into three eighth notes)
