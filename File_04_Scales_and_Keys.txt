Subject: Scales, Key Signatures, and The Circle of Fifths

A scale is a sequence of notes arranged in a specific order of whole steps and half steps. A half step is the smallest interval in Western music (e.g., C to C#). A whole step is equal to two half steps (e.g., C to D).

Major Scale: A seven-note scale with a happy, bright sound. The pattern of intervals is: Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Whole-Half (W-W-H-W-W-W-H).
Minor Scale: There are three types of minor scales, which have a sadder, more melancholic sound.
Natural Minor: W-H-W-W-H-W-W.
Harmonic Minor: Same as natural minor, but with a raised 7th note. This creates an augmented second between the 6th and 7th degrees.
Melodic Minor: Same as natural minor, but with a raised 6th and 7th note when ascending. When descending, it is the same as the natural minor scale.
A Key Signature is a set of sharp (♯) or flat (♭) symbols placed on the staff at the beginning of a piece. It indicates which notes are to be consistently raised or lowered throughout the music, defining the key of the piece.

The Circle of Fifths is a visual diagram that shows the relationship between all 12 major and minor keys. Moving clockwise, each new key is a perfect fifth higher than the last, adding one sharp to the key signature. Moving counter-clockwise, each new key is a perfect fifth lower, adding one flat. It is an essential tool for understanding key relationships, harmony, and modulation
