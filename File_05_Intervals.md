Subject: Musical Intervals

An interval is the distance in pitch between two notes. Intervals are described by their number (quantity) and their quality.

Number: To find the number, count the lines and spaces between the two notes, including the notes themselves. For example, C to E is a third (C-1, D-2, E-3).

Quality: The quality describes the precise size of the interval. The main qualities are:

Major (M): Used for seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths in a major scale above the tonic.
Minor (m): A major interval lowered by one half step.
Perfect (P): Used for unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves. These intervals have a stable, consonant sound.
Augmented (A): A major or perfect interval raised by one half step.
Diminished (d): A minor or perfect interval lowered by one half step.
Intervals can be harmonic (played at the same time) or melodic (played in sequence).

Inverting an interval means moving the lower note up an octave so it becomes the higher note. When inverted, major intervals become minor, augmented become diminished, and perfect intervals remain perfect. The number of the inverted interval can be found by subtracting the original interval number from 9 (e.g., a 3rd inverts to a 6th)
