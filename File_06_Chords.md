Subject: Chords and Triads

A chord is a combination of three or more notes played simultaneously. The most basic and common type of chord is a triad, which is a three-note chord built by stacking two thirds on top of a root note.

There are four basic qualities of triads:

Major Triad: Consists of a Root, a Major Third, and a Perfect Fifth. It has a happy, stable sound. (e.g., C Major: C-E-G)
Minor Triad: Consists of a Root, a Minor Third, and a Perfect Fifth. It has a sad, melancholic sound. (e.g., C Minor: C-Eb-G)
Diminished Triad: Consists of a Root, a Minor Third, and a Diminished Fifth. It has a tense, dissonant, and unstable sound. (e.g., C Diminished: C-Eb-Gb)
Augmented Triad: Consists of a Root, a Major Third, and an Augmented Fifth. It has a strange, dreamy, and unsettling sound. (e.g., C Augmented: C-E-G#)
Chord Inversions: A chord is in root position when the root is the lowest note. If a different note of the chord is in the bass, the chord is inverted.

Root Position: The root is the lowest note.
First Inversion: The third of the chord is the lowest note.
Second Inversion: The fifth of the chord is the lowest note.
Seventh Chords are four-note chords created by adding a third on top of a triad. Common types include Major 7th, Minor 7th, and Dominant 7th chords, which are essential to jazz and pop harmony.
