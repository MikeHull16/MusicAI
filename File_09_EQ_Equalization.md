Subject: EQ (Equalization)

Equalization (EQ) is the most fundamental tool in mixing. It is the process of adjusting the volume (amplitude) of specific frequency ranges within a sound. Essentially, EQ is a highly advanced tone control, allowing you to shape the character of any instrument or voice.

The Frequency Spectrum: The range of human hearing is roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). This spectrum is typically divided into bands:

Sub-Bass (20-60 Hz): The deep rumble you feel more than hear. The fundamental of kick drums and sub-bass sounds.
Bass (60-250 Hz): The bottom end of the mix. Contains the fundamental notes of bass guitars and the body of kick drums.
Low-Mids (250-500 Hz): Can make sounds full and warm, but too much can make a mix sound "muddy" or "boxy."
Mid-Range (500 Hz - 2 kHz): Where the human ear is most sensitive. Contains the main body of vocals, guitars, and snares. Crucial for presence and clarity.
Upper-Mids (2 kHz - 6 kHz): The range of attack, clarity, and "forwardness." Boosting here can make an instrument cut through the mix, but too much is harsh and fatiguing.
Treble / Highs (6 kHz - 20 kHz): Contains sparkle, air, and brilliance. The sound of cymbal sizzle and vocal "air."
Common EQ Controls:

Filter (High-Pass / Low-Pass): A High-Pass Filter (HPF) removes all frequencies below a set point. A Low-Pass Filter (LPF) removes all frequencies above a set point. This is the primary tool for cleaning up a mix by removing unwanted low-end rumble or high-end hiss.
Bell Curve: The most common EQ shape. It boosts or cuts a range of frequencies around a central point. You can control the Gain (how much to boost/cut), the Frequency (which point to center on), and the Q or Bandwidth (how wide or narrow the boost/cut is).
Shelf: Boosts or cuts all frequencies above (high shelf) or below (low shelf) a set point.
Two Philosophies of EQ:

Subtractive EQ: Cutting unwanted frequencies to make room for other instruments. This is generally preferred as the first step. For example, cutting the low frequencies from a guitar to make space for the bass guitar.
Additive EQ: Boosting frequencies to enhance the character of a sound. Used more sparingly to add presence, brightness, or body.
