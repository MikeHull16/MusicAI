Subject: EQ (Equalization)

Equalization (EQ) is the most fundamental tool in mixing. It is the process of adjusting the volume (amplitude) of specific frequency ranges within a sound. Essentially, EQ is a highly advanced tone control, allowing you to shape the character of any instrument or voice.

The Frequency Spectrum: The range of human hearing is roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). This spectrum is typically divided into bands:

Sub-Bass (20-60 Hz): The deep rumble you feel more than hear. The fundamental of kick drums and sub-bass sounds.
Bass (60-250 Hz): The bottom end of the mix. Contains the fundamental notes of bass guitars and the body of kick drums.
Low-Mids (250-500 Hz): Can make sounds full and warm, but too much can make a mix sound "muddy" or "boxy."
Mid-Range (500 Hz - 2 kHz): Where the human ear is most sensitive. Contains the main body of vocals, guitars, and snares. Crucial for presence and clarity.
Upper-Mids (2 kHz - 6 kHz): The range of attack, clarity, and "forwardness." Boosting here can make an instrument cut through the mix, but too much is harsh and fatiguing.
Treble / Highs (6 kHz - 20 kHz): Contains sparkle, air, and brilliance. The sound of cymbal sizzle and vocal "air."
