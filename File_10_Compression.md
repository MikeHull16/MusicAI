Subject: Compression

Compression is the process of reducing a sound's dynamic range. Dynamic range is the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of a performance. A compressor makes the loud parts quieter, and by then increasing the overall volume (makeup gain), it makes the quiet parts seem louder. The result is a more consistent and "punchy" sound that sits better in a dense mix.

Key Compressor Controls:

Threshold: The volume level at which the compressor starts working. Any part of the signal that is above the threshold will be compressed. Any part below it will be unaffected.
Ratio: Determines how much the signal is turned down once it crosses the threshold. A ratio of 4:1 means that for every 4 decibels (dB) the signal goes above the threshold, only 1 dB will be output. Higher ratios (like 10:1 or âˆž:1) are called "limiting" and are very aggressive.
Attack: How quickly the compressor starts working after the signal crosses the threshold. A fast attack will clamp down on the very beginning of a sound (the transient), which can reduce punch. A slow attack will let the initial transient through before compressing, which can enhance punch. Crucial for shaping drums.
Release: How quickly the compressor stops working after the signal falls back below the threshold. A short release can sound punchy but can also create an unnatural "pumping" artifact. A long release provides smoother, more transparent compression.
Makeup Gain: After compression reduces the peaks, the overall signal is quieter. Makeup Gain allows you to turn the entire compressed signal back up, bringing up the quieter details and making the sound feel more powerful and present.
Common Uses:

Vocals: To even out the volume of a singer's performance, making every word audible.
Drums: To shape the "punch" and "sustain" of kicks, snares, and other percussive elements.
Bass: To create a solid, consistent low-end foundation.
Mix Bus (Glue): Using a gentle compressor on the entire mix to make all the elements sound more cohesive, as if they were played in the same room.
