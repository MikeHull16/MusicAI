Subject: The Goal and Mindset of Mixing

Mixing is not about making individual instruments sound good in isolation; it is the art and science of blending all the individual tracks in a project into a single, cohesive, and emotionally impactful stereo file. The goal is to serve the song and enhance the artist's vision.

The Three Core Objectives of a Mix:

Balance: Every element should be audible and sit at an appropriate level. The listener should be able to hear all the important parts without straining, and no single element should be so loud that it masks others.
Clarity and Separation: Each instrument should occupy its own space, preventing the mix from sounding "muddy" or cluttered. The listener should be able to distinguish between different instruments easily. This is achieved by managing the frequency spectrum and stereo field.
Enhancement and Emotion: A good mix elevates the song's emotional impact. It adds excitement, creates depth and space, and guides the listener's focus throughout the song's journey. It makes a static recording feel alive and dynamic.
The Mixing Mindset:

Listen, Don't Just Look: Your ears are your most important tool, not your eyes. Close your eyes frequently to focus only on the sound. Don't rely on plugin presets or visualizers to make decisions for you.
Serve the Song: Every decision—every EQ cut, every compression setting, every reverb choice—should have a reason that supports the overall song. Never add an effect just for the sake of it. The most important element (usually the vocal) must be protected at all costs.
Don't Mix in Solo: While it's necessary to solo a track to fix a problem, the vast majority of your mixing decisions must be made while listening to the entire mix. A guitar that sounds perfect in solo might be completely wrong in the context of the full track.
Take Frequent Breaks: Your ears get tired and your perspective gets skewed after listening to the same loop for an extended period. Take 5-10 minute breaks every hour to reset your hearing and maintain objectivity.
Reference, Reference, Reference: Constantly compare your mix to professionally mixed and mastered songs in a similar genre. This will keep your decisions grounded and help you identify what your mix might be lacking.
