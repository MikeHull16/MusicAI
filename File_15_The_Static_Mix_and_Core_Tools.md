Subject: Building the Foundation with Volume, Panning, and EQ

The "static mix" is the foundation created using only the most essential tools. If you can make a mix sound good with only these, you're 90% of the way there.

1. Volume (The Front-to-Back Dimension):
Volume is your primary tool for creating a sense of depth and focus. Louder elements sound closer; quieter elements sound further away.

The Process: Start with all faders down. Bring up the most important element first (usually the lead vocal or main instrument). Then, one by one, bring in the other instruments, using their faders to tuck them in around the main element. The goal is to find a level for everything where it is audible and supports the lead element without overpowering it.
2. Panning (The Left-to-Right Dimension):
Panning places instruments in the stereo field, from left to right. Its main purpose is to create separation and width.

The Process:
Center Stage: Keep the most important, foundational elements in or near the center. This includes the kick drum, snare drum, lead vocal, and bass.
Create Balance: If you pan one instrument to the left, consider panning a similar instrument to the right to maintain a balanced stereo image. For example, if you have two rhythm guitars, pan one 80% left and the other 80% right.
Use the Full Spectrum: Don't be afraid to pan things hard left and right. Use different positions (e.g., 30% left, 60% right, 100% left) to create a wide and interesting soundscape.
3. EQ (The Height/Frequency Dimension):
After balancing levels and panning, EQ is used to carve out space for each instrument in the frequency spectrum.

The Process:
High-Pass Everything (Almost): Use a High-Pass Filter (HPF) on every track except your kick drum and sub-bass. This removes unnecessary low-end mud and rumble that clutters the mix. For a vocal, you might filter everything below 100 Hz. For a hi-hat, you might filter everything below 500 Hz. This is the single most powerful mixing move for creating clarity.
Find and Cut Problem Frequencies: If two instruments are fighting for space, they are likely competing in the same frequency range. For example, a piano and an acoustic guitar both have a lot of information in the low-mids (200-500 Hz). Use a "bell" EQ to cut a small amount of that range from one instrument to make space for the other. This "subtractive EQ" is more effective than boosting.
Boost for Character: After cleaning up the mix with cuts, use small, wide boosts to add character, such as adding "air" to a vocal around 10-12 kHz or adding "body" to a snare around 200 Hz.
