Subject: Using Compression, Reverb, and Delay

Once the static mix is solid, these tools add punch, control, and a sense of three-dimensional space.

1. Compression (Controlling Dynamics):
Compression controls the dynamic range of an instrument, making it more consistent in volume.

The Process:
Tame Peaks: On a dynamic vocal or bass performance, use a compressor with a medium attack and release to catch the loudest peaks, making the overall performance feel more even and controlled. A ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 is a good starting point.
Add Punch: On drums, use a compressor with a slow attack and fast release. The slow attack lets the initial "hit" (transient) pass through untouched before the compressor clamps down, which accentuates the punch of the drum.
Glue (Bus Compression): Use a gentle compressor on a group of instruments (like all the drums) or even the entire mix. With a low ratio (2:1) and slow attack, it can make all the elements "gel" together and sound more cohesive.
2. Reverb and Delay (Creating Depth):
These time-based effects create the illusion of a physical space.

The Process (Using Sends/Buses): Create one or two dedicated reverb tracks (Aux/Bus) and one or two delay tracks. Send a copy of the signal from your instruments to these tracks.
Create a Cohesive Space: Send small amounts of many instruments to a single "Room" or "Hall" reverb. This makes it sound like all the instruments were recorded together in the same space.
Create Depth: Instruments with more reverb will sound further away. Instruments that are mostly "dry" (little to no reverb) will sound closer and more intimate. Use this to your advantage to create a front-to-back soundstage.
Add Interest: Use a rhythmic, tempo-synced delay on a vocal or guitar part to create an interesting echo that adds energy and fills space in the arrangement. Use pre-delay on your reverb to keep the source sound clear and upfront before the reverb tail begins.
