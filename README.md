AI MUSIC CREATION

DESCRIPTION:
Music AI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to be a creative partner for musicians, producers, and songwriters. It acts as an expert in music theory, a composition assistant, and a source of inspiration to help users create music.

CORE FEATURES:

Deep musical knowledge for theory questions.
Collaborative songwriting and lyric brainstorming.
Genre-specific advice for styles like Electronic, Pop, Rock, and Jazz.
Insights into music production techniques.
An engaging and supportive personality to make creating music interactive.
HOW IT WORKS:
MA's intelligence is built in two parts. First, its core personality is defined by a detailed set of text prompts within the MyShell platform. Second, its specific factual knowledge (like definitions and chord progressions) is stored in an external digital library built with GitBook, which the AI reads to answer questions accurately.

HOW TO USE:
You can chat with MA directly on the MyShell platform. To see it in action, ask it questions like:

"Can you help me start a new song?"
"What's the difference between a major and minor scale?"
"Give me a chord progression for a rock song."
TECHNOLOGY USED:

Platform: MyShell
Knowledge Base: GitBook
Engine: Large Language Models (LLMs)
FUTURE PLANS:
Future updates will focus on integrating tools (APIs) for generating MIDI and audio files directly, expanding the knowledge base with more advanced topics, and adding memory to recall past user sessions.
